# Part 2: Mass Surveillance

## Introduction

In [Part 1 on Mass Surveillance](module_06a.md), we learned how the applications on your smartphone collect location data that is then shared with data aggregators who trade our detailed and timestamped location information. This information can be easily used to identify you and your habits; they can be used to paint a detailed picture of where you spend the night, where you pray, whether you visit a methadone clinic or psychiatrist's office or a massage parlor. In the United States, as in most of the world, no federal law limits collecting or selling this information.

Here, we will continue exploring topic of mass surveillance with a focus on solutions/actions. Additionally, we will learn how our location data can be used to generate trust scores, an alternative credit score, based on where we go and who we see. Trust scores can be used to assess the trustworthiness of individuals and thus determine their eligibility for employment, lending, education, etc. We examine the ethical implication of using trust scores and whether they should be used.

# Measuring Accuracy

## Introduction

For schools, the GPA is used to summarize a student's academic performance, for borrowers, credit scores predict their ability to pay back a loan. Similarly, performance metrics (e.g., [accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy)) are a critical component of that Machine Learning/AI systems utilize to assess their performance on a task. 

Here, we will explore the limits of metrics, including the fact that they remain proxies for measuring the things we **really** care about, and they can be manipulated (See Goodhart's law). Moreover, we will learn how to reduce the harmful effects of unthinkingly reliance on metrics.

## In-class individual tasks

* Are there potential harms from using the *students' test scores* to assess teacher performance? 
* Are there potential harms from using the *watch time* metric in recommendation algorithms like YouTube's?


## In-class group task

* What metrics would you propose for assessing the recommender systems of social media/video platforms and indicate that the engagement and enjoyment ?
* What metrics would you propose to assess teacher performance?

*Read the entire assignment before starting.*

### Q1: Create private Github repo  (2 points)

Create a private Github repository (`data202-01`) for the class. Create 5 folders with names: `hw1`, `hw2`, `hw3`, `hw4`, and `final_exam` for all your assignments:
```
data202/
├── README.md
├── hw1
├── hw2
├── hw3
├── hw4
├── final_exam
```
This is where you'll submit all your assignments. Since this is a private Github repo, only you and your collaborators would have access to it. Please add me as a collaborator:```Settings > Collaborators > Add people > type "anwala" > Press select a collaborator above```.

### Q2: Homework Reports (3 points)

1. From the `hw1` folder of your private GitHub assignment repo, create a new Markdown file named `hw1_report.md` and copy the content from [data202_report_template.md](data202_report_template.md) into it. 

2. Modify the content to include your name, class (DATA 202), assignment number/title, and dates for this exercise.

3. Upload an image to your GitHub repo and include it in place of the "Growth of the Early Web" image. Make sure to change the description of the image in the report, too.

4. Edit the first table so that it matches the first 4 weeks of our class schedule, as given in our [syllabus](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/syllabus.md#summary-schedule).

5. Go to Q3 and answer the questions. Include your responses in this report.

6. In the References section, replace the placeholder references with three webpages that you've visited so far this semester related to the class. These should include both the title of the webpage/article and the URL.

7. Finally, make sure that your `hw1` folder in your GitHub assignments repo contains the final version of your edited report file (`hw1_report.md`) and your included image.  In your final commit, use the commit message `@anwala ready to grade`.

## Q3: digitial footprint  (15 points)

Take your digitial footprint data and select at least 3 traces (e.g., location data, body vitals like heart rate and activity) and address the following questions:
1. Identify specific ways in which organizations are mining (aka using) this data and the purpose.
2. Identify benefits surrounding such large-scale mining and possible ethical concerns surrounding the large-scale mining of this data.
3. Do the benefits outway the (possible) harms?

# Ethics in Data Science (DATA 202-01) Group Project Description
**Due:** December 17, 2024

#### Introduction

The goals of this group project include applying knowledge of Ethics to solve real-world problems. Additionally the project aims to foster and assess your problem-solving, collaboration, time management, and communication skills. These skills are essential for success.

Groups would choose a topic based on one of the class modules, identify a widely used technology
and concerns surrounding its use, and provide remedies. 

#### Group formation and task division

Students are expected to form groups of **five** members (maximum), choose a group name, nominate a group leader, and divide/assign subtasks to members. Next, groups must negotiate with me to finalize the selection of the group topic and the task division by **October 13, 2024**.

When forming groups I encourage you to maximize the diversity of expertise by forming groups that feature different majors (e.g., CS/DS, Biology, Business). I reserve the right to assign students to existing groups for those without groups.

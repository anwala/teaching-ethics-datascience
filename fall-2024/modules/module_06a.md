# Part 1: Mass Surveillance

## Introduction

Every day as you go about your various businesses, applications on your smartphone request your location data as part of various tasks such as, getting accurate weather or booking transportation. This location data is then shared with data aggregators that collect and trade detailed and timestamped location data of your daily movement. This information can be easily used to identify you and your habits; they can be used to paint a detailed picture of where you spend the night, where you pray, whether you visit a methadone clinic or psychiatrist's office or a massage parlor. In the United States, as in most of the world, no federal law limits collecting or selling this information.

Here, we will learn how the personal devices we love enable mass surveillance and its ethical implications which includes the power imbalance between the watchers and the watched.

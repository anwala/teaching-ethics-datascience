# People as data generators & ethical framework

## Introduction

Whether making a call on a cell phone or searching for a recipe on a search engine, or swiping a credit card to make a purchase, the technologies that we have come to love and cannot live without collect massive amounts of data about our lives. This data is controlled by large corporations that can build sophisticated software to predict our behaviors and target us with ads.

Here, we will explore how our interaction with technology generates data and investigate how an ethical framework is needed to honor the privacy and intent of people (the data generators) while maximizing good.

## In-class individual task

* Create your detailed timestamped digital footprint for a normal day. E.g.,
| **Item** | **Time** | **Activity**       | **Digital trace**                                                     |
|----------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.       | 6am      | Check weather      | Location data                                                         |
| 2.       | 6am      | Check smart watch  | Location, Heart rate, sleep information, physical activity level, etc |
| 3.       | 6:30 am  | Check school email | All student/faculty interactions                                      |
| ...      | ...      | ...                | ...                                                                   |

* What would you permit companies to do with you data?
* What would you permit companies to NOT do with you data?

## In-class group task

* Apply the ethical framework to create policies governing the use of your digital footprint to maximize good and minimize harm.

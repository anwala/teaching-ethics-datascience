# Privacy

## Introduction

Consider three possible definitions of privacy:

1. The degree to which you control your information, 
2. Whether others have access to you and your information, and
3. The negotiated norms around how personal information should be collected, shared, used (and by whom). 

We will focus on the third definition, discuss the limitations of the first two, and investigate whether current targeted advertisement systems violate privacy. Also, we will identify the responsible parties for any privacy violations, the harms, or diminishment of rights.

# Fairness and Justice

## Introduction

Machine Learning/AI models are used to allocate (scarce) resources (e.g., vaccines, medical care, loans), which naturally raises questions fairness. Here we study the ideas of *Justice and Fairness*, to analyze whether the COMPAS sentencing algorithm is fair.

## Concepts

## In-class discussion/questions

* Is using COMPAS to make sentencing or parole decisions fair? Why or why not?

## In-class group task

* Develop a fair and just sentencing or parole system. What are the principles to ensure fairness? What are the limitations?

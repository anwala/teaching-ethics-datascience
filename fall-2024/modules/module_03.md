# Privacy

## Introduction

Daily on the web, our activities are tracked click-by-click and collected and sold by data brokers to third parties for the purpose of targeted advertising raising multiple privacy concerns about the extent we control our digital footprint.

Consider three possible definitions of privacy:

1. The degree to which you control your information, 
2. Whether others have access to you and your information, and
3. The negotiated norms around how personal information should be collected, shared, used (and by whom). 

We will focus on the third definition and investigate whether current targeted advertisement systems violate privacy. Also, we will identify the responsible parties for any privacy violations, the harms, and explore possible solutions for privacy-aware targeted advertising.

## In-class group task: discussion/questions (randomized group assignment)

Using the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), 
* Enumerate specific targeted advertising technologies/cases that violate privacy.
* Who is responsible for any privacy violations with targeted advertising?

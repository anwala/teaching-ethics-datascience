# W&M DATA 202-02 - Ethics in Data Science, Fall 2024 Syllabus

[Jump to Summary Schedule](#summary-schedule) | [Self](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/syllabus.md)

## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to critical, ethical, and moral issues surrounding data and society. It blends social and technological perspectives on data with ethics, policy, and case examples. We will explore a broad range of topic --- from Algorithmic Bias to Interpretability in Machine Learning --- to help students develop a workable understanding of current ethical issues in data science. 

Moreover, the course examines the ethical questions and dilemmas that arise in the development of technologies that affect the lives of peoples. Students will debate issues surrounding bias, privacy, surveillance, discrimination, and transparency, throughout the development life cycle of applications ‚Äì from dataset generation to model development and evaluation.

**Prerequisites:** DATA 201, 146 or CSCI 146.

## Course Venue and Time

John E. Boswell Hall, room 102. Tuesdays/Thursdays 8am -‚Äì 9:20am

## Course Objectives

After completing this course, you should be able to do the following:

* Develop a mental framework to identify ethical dilemmas and issues that manifest in data collection and algorithm development/deployment.

* Explain the current ethical issues in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence/Machine-Learning.

* Apply pre-existing theories to understand and propose solutions to a particular ethical issue.

* Etc.

### Textbook

There is no recommended textbook for this class. Each module is accompanied with online resources. In a few cases however, we will read from [Dr. Kirsten Martin's](https://kirstenmartin.net/) [Ethics of Data and Analytics: Concepts and Cases](https://wm.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01COWM_INST/g9pr7p/alma991033870654103196), which is available online through the William & Mary Library.

## Grading

There will be a total of **100 points** (60 points for assignments, 20 points for final exam (no midterms), and 20 points for participation).

### Assignment Types

I will post all assignments on our [DATA 202-02 course website](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/README.md). Your grade in this class will be based on the following components:

**Homework (HW)** - **60** points

* 4 homework assignments (HW1 -- HW4), each worth 15 points
* All work must be your own. You may use resources on the Internet for reference as long as you cite your sources (including URL). Group work on HW assignments is not acceptable.

**Participation/Attendance** - **20** points

Participation is very important and contributes additional dimensions to discussions. You are expected to complete all assigned readings before class and be ready to discuss with your peers, and apply your knowledge during class learning activities. 

Throughout the semester you will have the opportunity to accumulate a maximum of **20** participation points (2 points maximum per week) for the following in-class activities: 
1. Summary of a concept
2. Summary of a case
3. Contribution of important points or questions grounded in cases/concept
4. Participating in in-class individual task
5. Participating in in-class group task/debate

**No Midterm exam**

**Final exam (Group project with individual component)**- **20** points

## Course History

This course was previously taught by [Dr. Jaime Settle](https://jsettle.people.wm.edu/index.html), Associate Professor of the Government Department at William & Mary.

The current edition heavily borrows structure & content from [Dr. Kirsten Martin's](https://kirstenmartin.net/), Ethics of Data Analytics course. She is the William P. and Hazel B. White Professor of Technology Ethics and Professor of IT, Analytics, and Operations in the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.

## Course Policies

### Piazza

Each student must check the class [Piazza (DATA 202-02)](https://piazza.com/class/lz70wfvqakt7fu/) daily. You should use our class Piazza forum to ask and answer general course-related questions. I will use Piazza to notify you about important updates (assignment deadline changes, office hours cancellations, etc.).

### Participation

Regularly stay involved in class activities. This includes completing all assigned readings before class, engaging in in-class individual/group activities, checking Piazza for announcements, submitting assignments on time, and responding to discussion posts in a timely manner.

### Generative AI Use

One of the most important skills you could learn is problem-solving; the ability to go from knowing nothing about a subject, to navigating little or vast amounts of information to address question, and develop an understanding of the subject. This process is not straightforward, sometimes is involves trial and error through experimentation. It can be frustrating and difficult and requires patience and diligence. But developing good problem-solving skills is rewarding and gives you the ability to become an independent researcher who can be entrusted with solving problems.

I believe using generative AI technology to **think** for you, could suppress your problem-solving skills and rob you of the opportunity to develop the cognitive ability to navigate the unknown. So I will not permit using of generative AI as a substitute for your mental process. However, you may use the technology to find information (ensure to verify the accuracy) as long as you note when you use it.

For more details on good and bad use of generative AI, watch [AI can do your homework. Now what?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEJ0_TVXh-I)

### Seeking Help

The course Piazza forum should be your first reference for questions about the class. If you have questions about the course requirements or materials, post your questions on Piazza. For extra help, attend [office hours](https://alexandernwala.com/contact/).

### [Student Accessibility Services](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/)

W&M's Student Accessibility Services offer a variety of services (e.g., [Watson Lab](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/watsonlab/index.php) and [special needs housing](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentaccessibilityservices/students/services/specialhousing/index.php)) for William & Mary students.

The mission of Student Accessibility Services is to create a barrier-free environment for matriculating students with debilitating diagnosed conditions by considering reasonable accommodations upon request on an individual and flexible basis. 

Student Accessibility Services strives to foster student independence, to encourage self-determination, to emphasize empowerment and accommodation over limitation, and to create a comprehensive, accessible environment to ensure that individuals are viewed on the basis of contribution, not deficit.

## W&M's [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/index.php)

Among the most significant traditions of William & Mary is its student-administered honor system. The essence of the honor system is individual responsibility. We entrust students to maintain the Code and adjudicate matters involving alleged violations of the Code.

The Honor Code is an enduring tradition at the University with documented history that originates as far back as 1736. Today, students administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the University. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs.

The Honor Code prohibits lying, cheating, and stealing. For definitions of each offense, view [Section VI: Infractions](https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/communityvalues/studenthandbook/honor_system/section_VI/index.php) of the Honor Code.
* **Lying:** the presentation of false information with the intent to deceive.
* **Cheating:** including, but not limited to, the following acts: 
  * Plagiarism
  * Unauthorized Assistance/Collaboration
  * Use of Unauthorized Materials
  * Unauthorized Dual Submission of Previous Academic Work
  * Time Constraint Violation
  * Directions Violation
* **Stealing:** knowingly taking or appropriating the property of another, including property of the university, without the rightful owner's permission and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently or substantially. One does not receive rightful permission if it is induced by fraud or deception.

### Mass Surveillance  (10 points)

Revisit your digital [footprint](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/modules/module_01.md#in-class-individual-task). For at least five applications that collect your data, investigate how you can protect your privacy. Specifically, consider the following,
1. Are there measures you can take to protect your privacy? This includes actions within your control (e.g., `switching off location tracking in the control panel`)
2. Does the application provide you with a mechanism of protecting your privacy? This includes actions outside your reach that the application provides (e.g., `end-to-end encryption`)

Ensure to support your responses with citations.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to your private GitHub repo (inside the `hw3` folder).  Your repo should include your report, images, etc. that you developed to answer the questions.  Include "Ready to grade @anwala" in your final commit message.

# Ethics in Data Science (DATA 202-01) Group Project Description (20 points)

**Due:** December 17, 2024, 2pm ET

#### Introduction

The goals of this group project includes fostering and assessing your real-world problem-solving skills, collaboration, time management, and communication skills. These skills are essential for success.

Groups will choose a topic based on one of the [class modules](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/README.md), identify a widely used technology, the ethical dilemma surrounding its use, and provide remedies by applying a previously explored solution (e.g., [ethical framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20240513055008/https://honors.umaine.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2020/10/A-Framework-for-Thinking-Ethically.pdf), [transparency & consent framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20240415102757/https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethical-considerations-targeted-advertising-data-adjei-ohene-/), [dataset provenance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010), [fairness & justice](https://github.com/anwala/teaching-ethics-datascience/blob/main/fall-2024/modules/module_05.md)) 

#### Group formation and task division

Students are expected to form groups of **five** members (maximum), choose a group name, nominate a group leader, divide/assign subtasks to members, and negotiate with me to finalize the selection of the previous details by **October 13, 2024**.

When forming groups I encourage you to maximize the diversity of expertise by forming groups that feature different majors (e.g., CS/DS, Biology, Business). I reserve the right to assign students to existing groups for those without groups or for some unseen circumstance.

#### Grading rubric

* Presentation highlights limitations of proposed solutions/future work
* Correctness/completeness research questions
* Presentation is well-organized, cites sources, utilizes illustrations (e.g., images) to aid in explanations, and presenter(s) effectively communicated their solution to class

### Checkpoints

Throughout the December 3 and December 5, 2024 have been reserved for Group project clinic. I'll encourage you

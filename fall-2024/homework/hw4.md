### Introduction

Each time you open your favorite social media site application, [a recommendation algorithm](https://web.archive.org/web/20240227031020/https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/technology-primer-social-media-recommendation-algorithms) automatically selects, ranks, and presents the content you see on your feed.

To maximize profit (gotten through ads and user data collection), social media companies design and continuously fine-tune their black-box proprietary recommendation algorithms to prioritize user engagement, ensuring that folks stay longer on their sites. For example, [YouTube estimates that over 70 percent of views on the platform come from the company's recommended section, as opposed to self-directed searches or shared links](https://web.archive.org/web/20240227031020/https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/technology-primer-social-media-recommendation-algorithms). 

Prioritizing profit has resulted in multiple unhealthy negative outcomes such increased polarization and mental health challenges.

### Content moderation  (10 points)

Imagine you were tasked with designing a social media recommendation algorithm. 

1. Specify your goal (e.g., maximize `profit` or `engagement`) for the recommendation algorithm. 

2. Spell out in details how your algorithm would select, rank, and present content on user feeds. Ensure that you include enough details to enable the software implementation of your solution.

3. Specify your content moderation policies. Ensure to include enough details to avoid ambiguity to facilitate the implementation of your policies.
